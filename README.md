#Face Attendance System Project

Overview

This project implements a face attendance system using Python and OpenCV. The system can be used to mark the attendance of employees, students, or other individuals in a secure and efficient way.

Features

Facial recognition: The system uses a facial recognition algorithm to identify and verify individuals.
Attendance tracking: The system tracks the attendance of individuals and generates reports.
User management: The system allows users to be registered and managed.

Requirements

Python 3
OpenCV
NumPy
Matplotlib


Known Issues

The system may not be able to accurately identify individuals in low-light conditions or when the individual's face is partially obscured.
The system may take some time to load the facial recognition model, especially on slower machines.

If you have any questions or problems using the system, please feel free to contact me at jgaurav117@gmail.com.
